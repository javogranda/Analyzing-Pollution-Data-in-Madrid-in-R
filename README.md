# Analyzing Pollution Data in Madrid

The work consists in analyzing a big dataset with hourly pollution data from Madrid, in the period 2011 to 2016.
We worked with 72 csv files, each one containing a piece of the information. Specifically, each csv contains the raw data for a concrete month of a concrete year (6 years, 12 months per year).

We will also work with two additional datasets:
- Weather.xlsx, containing daily time series for min, average, and max temperature, precipitations, humidity and wind in Madrid.
- parameters.png (image), containing the key for every pollutant code (eg. “08” NO2)
